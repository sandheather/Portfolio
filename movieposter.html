  <p class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island">One of my favourite movies because of the cinematography and special effects, tells the story of murder and how a family tries to move on. For the design of movie poster I wanted to show the fantasy world that the main character wanders within. She is between the world of the living and the world of the dead. Since she is between worlds I have her fading into the background.</p>
