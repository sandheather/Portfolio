  <p class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1-2 island-2">I decided to redesign the logo for the Rideau Animal Hospital. They have been providing help for 35 years and were in need of a revamp. I live in Manotick where this animal hospital is located so I wanted to incorporate the community into the logo. I also wanted to keep certain aspects of the old logo and make them less generic. For example the cat and dog head silhouettes are a generic image used by many hospitals. Therefore I went for a full body shape for the animals. What makes my logo unique is the positive and negative space the cross in the center creates. The dog and cat wrap around the cross, their legs forming a section of the cross. I added in swoops on either side to represent the river that flows around the community. The swoops also fill the empty space caused by the animals. To make the shapes of the animals, I based the design on a circle. This way the shapes are symmetrical. </p>
