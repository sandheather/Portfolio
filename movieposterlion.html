  <p class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 push-r island">The lion King is one of my favourite childhood movies. With this redesign of the movie poster I decided to use realistic images instead of illustrations like they used in the movie. A big part or the turning point in the movie would be when Simba "remembers who he is". He talks to his dad in the sky and it truly is a powerful moment.</p>
